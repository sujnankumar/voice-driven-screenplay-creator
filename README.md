# Screenplay Analyser

A voice-driven application that converts orally narrated stories into professional screenplays using AI. The **frontend**, built with React.js, provides a dynamic interface for users to record stories, view AI-styled screenplays in customized Markdown or tags, and interact with a chatbot for scriptwriting and design feedback. The **backend**, powered by Flask, handles voice transcription, AI processing for screenplay formatting, and bidirectional story-screenplay conversion. To set up, clone the repo, then for the backend: install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `python app.py`; for the frontend: install with `npm install` and run `npm start`.
